 * Space complexity => O(1) Constant space complexity to the 'power' argument. Behind the scenes 
 * what tail call optimization is doing is simple. Instead of  creating a new stack frame for each 
 * recursive call, itâ€™s rewriting over the same stack frame which would convert your O(n) space 
 * to O(1) space. It can do this, because each recursive call is no longer depending on other 
 * recursive calls to finish, nor is it relying on storing local variables in each unique context.
