//Suppose you're given a binary tree represented as an array. 
//For example, [3, 6, 2, 9, -1, 10] represents the following binary tree (where -1 is a non-existent node);
//        3
//      /   \
//    6      2
//   /      /
//  9      10
//Write a funciton that determines whether the left or right branch of the tree is larger. The size of each branch is the sum of the node values.
//The function should return "Right" if the right side is larger and "Left" if the left side is larger. If the tree has 0 nodes or if the size of the branches are equal, return the emptry string.
