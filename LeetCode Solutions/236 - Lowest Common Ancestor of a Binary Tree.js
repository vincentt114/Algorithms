// Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

// According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

 

// Example 1:


// Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
// Example 2:


// Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
// Output: 5
// Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
// Example 3:

// Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
// Output: 1

//input root node, 2 nodes
//output node
    //output represents the lowest common ancestor of the 2 nodes
//STRAT
    //use recursion
    //edge cases for when root is null or root is === to p or q -> return root
    //declare left and right variables and initialize to left and right nodes of root
    //if left is falsy (edge case on line 20) return right
    //if right is falsy return right
    //return root

var lowestCommonAncestor = function(root, p, q) {
  if (!root || root === p || root === q) return root;
  const left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
  const right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
  if (!left) return right;
  if (!right) return left;
  return root;
