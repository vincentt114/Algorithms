// You are given an array of logs. Each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is the identifier.

// There are two types of logs:

// Letter-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.
// Digit-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.
// Reorder these logs so that:

// The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
// The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
// The digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.
// Return the final order of the logs.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
// Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
// Explanation:
// The letter-log contents are all different, so their ordering is "art can", "art zero", "own kit dig".
// The digit-logs have a relative order of "dig1 8 1 5 1", "dig2 3 6".
// Example 2:

// Input: logs = ["a1 9 2 3 1","g1 act car","zo4 4 7","ab1 off key dog","a8 act zoo"]
// Output: ["g1 act car","a8 act zoo","ab1 off key dog","a1 9 2 3 1","zo4 4 7"]

//input array of strings
//output array of strings reorganized
    //RULES
        //letter before digit
        //letters are organized among themselves by the body
        //if letter body the same then identifier
        //digits remain in the same relative ordering as in input
//STRAT
    //create2 arrays letter digits
    //iteriate through logs and push the elements into their respective arrays
        //via looking at the 2nd block of letter/integer within the string -> use a splits method to check 1st eleemnt number and then rejoin when pushing
    //sort through letters array
        //check the body of a and b, by making a copy via slicing off the identifier
        //run locale compare
        //if return 0 then run localecompare on entirety of a b
    //return
